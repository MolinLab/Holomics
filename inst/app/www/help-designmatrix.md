# DIABLO design matrix

The design matrix used in the DIABLO analysis indicates whether there are prior known or calculated correlations between the datasets, which should be taken into consideration when analysing the datasets. For now Holomics only allows you to set one correlation value, which will be used for all pairwise correlations.
