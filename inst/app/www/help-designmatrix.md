# DIABLO design matrix

The design matrix used in the DIABLO analysis indicates whether there are prior known or calculated correlations between the datasets, which should be taken into consideration when analysing the datasets. When the user selects the datasets to be used for the DIABLO analysis, Holomics automatically calculates the pairwise correlations. The design matrix is then automatically set to the lowest calculated correlation. However, the user can always change the value, for example, if there is a prior established biological association between the datasets that should be used for the design matrix.
