Description: Shiny application, which allows you to perform single- and
    multi-omics analyses using your own omics datasets.  Therefore you
    upload the omics datasets and a metadata file and can then perform
    single-omics analysis to reduce the datasets.  Afterwards, going into
    the multi-omics datasets with the reduced datasets and let them get
    automatically tuned to identify correlations between the datasets is
    the end goal of the recommended 'Holomics workflow'.
