Description: A 'shiny' application, which allows you to perform single- and
    multi-omics analyses using your own omics datasets. After the upload 
    of the omics datasets and a metadata file, single-omics is performed
    for feature selection and dataset reduction. These datasets are used 
    for pairwise- and multi-omics analyses, where automatic tuning is 
    done to identify correlations between the datasets - the end goal 
    of the recommended 'Holomics' workflow.
    Methods used in the package were implemented in the package 'mixomics'
    by Florian Rohart,Benoît Gautier,Amrit Singh,Kim-Anh Lê Cao (2017) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005752>
    and are described there in further detail.
