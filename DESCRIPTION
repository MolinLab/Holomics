Description: Shiny application, which allows you to perform single- and
    multi-omics analyses using your own omics datasets. After the upload 
    of the omics datasets and a metadata file, single-omics is performed
    for feature selection and dataset reduction. These datasets are used 
    for pairwise- and multi-omics analyses, where automatic tuning is 
    done to identify correlations between the datasets - the end goal 
    of the recommended Holomics workflow.
