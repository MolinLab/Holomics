Title: An user-friendly R Shiny application for multi-omics data integration and analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Katharina", family = "Munk", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "kathimunk@gmail.com"),
    person(given = "Eva M.", family = "Molin", role = c("ctb")))
Description: Shiny application, which allows you to perform single- and multi-omics analyses using your own omics datasets.
  Therefore you upload the omics datasets and a metadata file and can then perform single-omics analysis to reduce the datasets.
  Afterwards, going into the multi-omics datasets with the reduced datasets and let them get automatically tuned to identfiy 
  correlations between the datasets is the end goal of the recommended 'Holomics workflow'.
