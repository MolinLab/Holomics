# Holomics

Holomics is a web application, which allows you to perform single and multi omics analyses. <br>
The used analyses methods are based on the <a href="http://mixomics.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">mixOmics</a> package.

With the current version Holomics can only be used with a test dataset. In the future you will be able to upload your data and use it.
