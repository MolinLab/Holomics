# Holomics

<img align="right" src="inst/app/www/img/logo.png" width=300> 

Holomics is an R Shiny application, which enables its users to perform single- and multi-omics analyses. Therefore, Holomics provides a user-friendly interface to upload the different datasets, choose and perform the various analyses and then presents the results to the user. To perform the various analyses Holomics uses the R package mixOmics. This means Holomics takes the input files, forwards them to the mixOmics algorithms and takes the resulting plots/tables and presents them to user. 

mixOmics provides numerous analyses algorithms, but Holomics only integrates the two single-omics algorithms "Principle Component Analysis (PCA)" and "Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)", one pairwise omics analysis called "sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS)" and one multi-omics analysis called "Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO)".

## Installation
### CRAN
~~~
install.packages("Holomics")
~~~

### Github
~~~
# Install devtools if it is not already installed
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Install Holomics package 
install_github("evasehr/Holomics")
~~~

## Start application
Either with 

~~~
library(Holomics)
runApp()
~~~

or 

~~~
Holomics::runApp()
~~~ 

## Workflow
To make use of all the functionality provided, the below described workflow should be followed. Firstly, the user needs to upload the datasets to be able to use them for the (single) omics analysis. Afterwards, the user should go with the datasets into the single-omics analysis, where key variables are identified and the datasets are filtered accordingly. After the single-omics analyses, the user can apply the multi-omics analyses to identify correlations between 2-n datasets. NOTE: If the user already uploaded pre-filtered (ideally by Holomics at an earlier time) datasets, it is possible to go directly into the multi-omics analysis.
